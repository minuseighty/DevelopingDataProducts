Data: The data was sourced from "http://www.nbastuffer.com/team_stats" which has comprehensive NBA team statistics. 
Since I downloaded the data and didn't create a link to the website the information might have changed,
but since the seasons I used are completed it should be consistent. 

The 4 varaibles I used to create Exploratory Data Analysis on this dataset are GP, OEFF, DEFF, and Year.
GP = Games Played
OEFF = Offensive Efficency, Points scored by the team per 100 possesions.
DEFF = Defensive Efficency, Points allowed by the team per 100 possesions.
Year = Year the season ended in.

The purpose of this analysis is to see if being efficient with/without the ball correlates to wins.
